Introduction
==================
This is a very simple C library for dealing with "foreign keys" (a term which I
am using very loosely). It depends on glib.

You can download the latest version of this software using git. The clone URL
for this project is git://github.com/eklitzke/libfk.git

Build & Install
==================
To compile this software you'll need to have the glib development headers and
libraries installed. For Ubuntu/Debian, the name of that package is
`libglib2.0-dev'. For Fedora, the name of the package is `glib2-devel'.

To build everything, just run `make'. To install, run `make install'. If you
want to change the installation prefix, you simply edit the Makefile and change
the definition of `prefix'.
